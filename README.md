## 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item  

### Prompt  
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  
- Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way?  
- How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?  
- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.  
- How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?  
- What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?  
- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

### Reflection

I write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs by focusing on **modularity** and **clear naming conventions**. In **Project One**, I created a reusable CRUD Python module for database interactions. This design made each operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) independent and easy to modify. The modular approach simplified debugging, scaling, and reuse, allowing the module to also be integrated into a REST API. 

For **Grazioso Salvare**, I developed a database and dashboard solution by first understanding their business model, ensuring the system was both functional and flexible. Unlike academic projects, this real-world client-focused project required balancing technical skills with client needs. 

In the future, I will focus on **database normalization** and **performance optimization** to ensure scalable and efficient systems. By continuing to build flexible, adaptable solutions, I can meet evolving client needs while improving both the functionality and performance of systems.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Modular Programming:** Simplified debugging and reuse through independent operations.
- **Real-World Application:** Balancing technical expertise with client requirements.
- **Future Focus:** Prioritizing database normalization and performance optimization for scalable systems.
